# MovieListingApp

An Android App built in Java that displays movies from The Movie Database. 

Uses a grid layout presentation for a marco level landing view which displays all movies and then the ability to click each movie individually for a micro level detailed view of the movie's information. 

Mostly this app is practice for: 
* fetching data off the Internet with theMovieDB API.
* building adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
* an opportunity to incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code.
